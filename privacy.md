# Privacy Policy for QR Contact Share

**Effective Date:** [01/01/2025]

QR Contact Share (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

QR Contact Share operates entirely on your device. The only contact information accessed is the one you explicitly select within the app to generate a QR code. This information is not saved, uploaded, or shared with us or any third parties.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The selected contact information is used **only** to:

- Generate a QR code on your device.
- Allow another person to scan the QR code and add the contact to their own address book.

**No data leaves your device.**

## 3. Third-Party Access

QR Contact Share does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or cloud services. No data is shared with any third party.

## 4. Permissions

The app requires access to your device's contacts solely to allow you to select a contact to share. This access is optional and under your control.

## 5. Security

Since QR Contact Share does not collect or transmit data, your contact information remains private and secure on your device.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

QR Contact Share does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. As we do not collect personal information, this app is compliant with COPPA by design.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If our privacy practices change in the future, we will update this policy and inform you through the app or app store.
